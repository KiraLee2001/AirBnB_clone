The airbnb project creates a clone of the airbnb website. Iit is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API and a frontend interface.
This project is the first part of building the airbnb clone. Its purpose is to make a command interpreter that manages the airbnb objects.
The commandline interpreter is started by executing the command ./console.py. The console creates, destroys and updates objects. To get a list of command options and their functions type help.
example:
olamide@ubuntu:~$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
